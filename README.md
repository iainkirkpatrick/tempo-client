## TEMPO-CLIENT

WIP - react / redux / apollo-client client for Tempo

### NOTES
- apollo-client looks worth experimenting with, even if perhaps overkill for an app like tempo


### TODO
- [X] at least one query to graphql server
- [X] general approach to querying that takes advantage of graphql
- [ ] basic view for projects / developers
  - [X] grid generated by dates and data
  - [ ] infinite scrolling for dates
- [ ] click on grid adds a project to a developer or vice-versa
