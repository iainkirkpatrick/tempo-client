## TEMPO-CLIENT

WIP - react / redux / apollo-client client for Tempo

### NOTES
- apollo-client looks worth experimenting with, even if perhaps overkill for an app like tempo


### TODO
- [X] at least one query to graphql server
- [ ] general approach to querying that takes advantage of graphql
- [ ] basic view for projects / developers
